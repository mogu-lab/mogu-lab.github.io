## Overview

Learning how to **evaluate** your progress is a **crucial component** of your development as an independent researcher. 
Like many of the other skills (e.g. reading research papers, conducting a literature search, soliciting research feedback from your collaborators, etc.), 
this is a skill that is **learned** through **deliberate practice**. 

Here, we provide you with a template to use in soliciting feedback from your research mentors.
We ask you that you share this document with them **ahead of time**, and then meet with them 1-on-1 to fill it out **together**. 
We encourage you to solicit feedback in a format similar to this every couple of weeks so you can ensure you're putting your efforts where they **matter most**.
Note that not all of the below items are relevant to you, so please answer as appropriate.


## Dispelling Common Myths

Before you begin your evaluation, we would like to **dispel** a few **myths** you may have:
1. It is as much your mentors' responsibility to provide you feedback as it is your responsibility to solicit feedback. As such, it is important you get in the **habit** of **explicitly** soliciting for the feedback you need to improve. This is also your chance to learn how your mentors see research skill development.
2. If your mentors bring up areas of growth, **it does NOT mean you're doing poorly**. You're in the beginning of your research journey, so it is expected you have lots to learn.
3. **Do not push this off** until you feel certain your mentors are happy with your progress. Many students have tendencies to "read tea leaves" (i.e. guess from facial expressions, messages, etc.) when trying to determine if your mentors are happy with them instead of asking directly. You may find that even at times you are unsure your mentors are happy with your progress, they actually are. 


## Guide

**Instructions:** For each of the categories of skills below, ask your mentor:
1. What are my strengths?
2. What are my areas of growth?

Since you're a student just starting on your research journey, there may be many areas of growth for you. 
This is, again, not an issue, but a natural product of where you are in the process. 
It is helpful, however, to agree with your mentors on which of the above areas of growth are the **highest priority** for the next few weeks. 
This will help ensure you're not spreading yourself too thin. 
As such, after discussing your strengths and areas of growth in every category below, ask your mentors the following questions:
1. Which of the areas of growth above should I focus on most in the next few weeks?
2. What are concrete ways to improve in the above areas of growth?
3. hen would it be helpful to check in again and re-evaluate how I'm doing?


## List of Skills

* **Teamwork and interdependence:** e.g.,
  * Asking for and receiving feedback 
  * Commitment to supporting/working with lab members
  * Setting expectations for internal and external collaborations (authorship, workflow, roles etc.)
  * Avoiding and resolving potential conflicts during collaborations
  * Working effectively with more senior folks or folks more experience/skilled in some area you’re working in
* **Presentation and communication of research:** e.g.,
  * Communicating research updates during 10min, 20min, 30min meetings
  * Effectively asking for technical feedback during research meetings
  * Listening to technical talks and asking questions during/after
  * Effectively communicating your own research to different audiences (in your lab, in your field, general audiences)
  * Writing and speaking in a mathematically/technically precise fashion
  * Communicating your research as an elevator pitch
* **Progress toward independent research, initiative, and creativity:** e.g.,
  * Designing small/large experiments to test hypotheses
  * Ability to come up with research ideas on all scales – thinking of directions for weekly progress or longer-term research projects
  * Pivoting from negative/unexpected results, forming hypotheses from the results, debugging, adapting research goal
  * Evaluating the novelty of a technical contribution in relation to a body of literature
  * Formalizing vague questions into concrete solvable problem statements
* **Task progress and completion:** e.g.,
  * Time management; balancing coursework, classes, etc; asking for help when needed
  * Setting achievable short and long-term goals/deadlines in advance 
  * Checking in/reporting progress toward established deadlines 
* **Research skills:** e.g.,
  * Learning background/foundational knowledge
  * Reading and evaluating literature
  * Mentoring more junior researchers/students
  * Networking 
  * Giving presentations at other labs/seminars/conferences
  * Assisting and writing grant proposals
  * Participation in department or national meetings, teaching/mentoring, leadership skills
