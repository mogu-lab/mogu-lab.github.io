**About.** While well-intuitioned, our approach to conversations about therapy and psychiatric hospitalization can also unintentionally undermine other's experiences and promote harmful values about mental health. Below we offer a few common, well-intentioned sentiments, language and actions to consider. For each, we then offer a alternative ways to engage.


## Well-Intentioned Sentiments

<table><thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Sentiment</th>
    <th>Implicit Implication</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>“I’m glad you decided to seek help.”<br>“I’m glad you were willing to receive help.”</td>
    <td>
      (a) While it's important to acknowledge someone's efforts to seek help, this statement can minimize their prior struggles; it might imply that their previous difficulties were their fault, that they haven’t been trying, and that they haven’t been seeking help or trying new things.
      <br/><br/>
      (b) While therapy provides structured help, the statement inappropriately centers the help, making it seem like the person is passive in the process. Therapy is not like breaking an arm (you get your cast on and your body does the rest); it requires constant effort and grit from the individual to overcome significant challenges.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>“You’re so strong / brave.”</td>
    <td>
      (a) Though intended as a compliment, it implies that seeking therapy is an extraordinary, rather than normal act. This can reinforce the stigma that therapy is appropriate only in “extreme” cases.
      <br/><br/>
      (b) This statement can also come across as having pity, imply that the person needs therapy / hospitalization because they are “weak.” Mental health challenges and disabilities are experiences that can affect anyone, regardless of their background. While some people may never face marginalization related to race, gender, or sexual orientation, they can still encounter circumstances that lead to disability and/or significant mental health challenges. It's crucial to understand that we all exist on a spectrum of mental health, rather than viewing individuals as inherently "strong" or "weak." This statement endorses the concept of “strong” vs. “weak” instead of promoting empathy, recognizing the shared potential for facing such challenges.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>“Why don’t you do something nice for yourself?”</td>
    <td>It’s important to do nice things for ourselves and practice self-care. At the same time, this may come across as trivialising significant mental health challenges that require more intense and structured interventions from healthcare professionals and supportive communities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>“Suicide is a cry for help”</td>
    <td>The idea that suicide is simply a "cry for help" is a misconception that can oversimplify and misrepresent the complex realities of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. It can:<br>Contribute to stigma by implying attention-seeking behavior, which can discourage individuals from speaking openly about their thoughts and seeking necessary support.<br>Downplay imminent risk and need for professional help and intervention.</td>

**Reframing.** After reading this, you might feel like you can't say anything. Instead, we offer one key way of engaging: instead of making value-statements about the individual or the experience, consider *asking them value-neutral questions about their experience to express your interest and to learn more*. For example, you can ask questions like:
- What's it been like for you?
- What have you found challenging?
- How has this experience affected you?
- How did people close to you react when you told them? And how did that make you feel?



## Well-Intentioned Actions



**Reframing.** As before, it's best not to assume you know what someone's experiencing and what they need. Instead, it's bask to *ask* them if you can be supportive, and if so, how. For example you can ask:
- "If there's a way for me to be a part of your mental health journey, please let me know---I realize that there might not be anything I can do, but if there is, I'd like to be a part of it."
- "I felt like when I \_\_\_\_\_, it had a negative effect on you. If you're open to it, I'd love to learn more about your experience and what I might do differently."
