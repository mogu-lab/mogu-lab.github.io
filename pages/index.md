MOGU Lab at Wellesley College is focused on enabling **effective** and **responsible** uses of expressive (deep) machine learning models in **safety-critical** domains like precision healthcare, in which increasing amounts of data hold the potential to improve human lives. Our research specifically focuses on developing methods to help us better **understand, predict, and prevent suicide** and related behaviors.

We work closely with **clinical collaborators** in the Boston area, including at Mass General Hospital, Franciscan Children's, and Harvard's Medical School and Department of Psychology, to develop **new machine learning methodology** that addresses the unique challenges found in their data.

We see clinicians' insights and lived experiences as invaluable. As such, our work **does not** look to replace clinicians, but instead, to develop effective **clinician-AI collaboration** by finding new ways to **meaningfully incorporate** their expertise into our methods.

Our work focuses both on the nitty-gritty details of the machine learning methodology, as well as on the broader **sociotechnical system** in which our methods will live. As such, we are equally as interested in ensuring our methods have the necessary **statistical properties** as we are in the necessary **human-facing properties** for good performance on their intended task and positive impact in their intended context.
